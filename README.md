This repository include 3 mini-projects which explore various Deep learning related algorithms in the Medtech domain.

1)Enzymes: Includes the classification of Enzymes into 6 classes. The enzymes and their interactions are represented in the form of graphs. After processing the data, Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN) is employed for removing the embeddings of the nodes which is then used as features and passed through classification models like LightGBM and RandomForest.
